# API Documentation for BoundedOverlayManager

## Introduction

This section details the API methods offered by the `BoundedOverlayManager` library. These methods enable programmatic control and customization of overlay behaviors, providing flexibility and dynamic interaction within your application.

## API Methods

### renderOverlays()

- Triggers the rendering of overlays.

### clearOverlays()

- Triggers the clearing of overlays. This method will not be effective if the `persistentlyShowOverlays` prop is set to `true`.

### updateOverlaysContainerBoundingBox()

- Updates the bounding box of the overlays container. When the bounding component itself or the window is resized the library will automatically update the bounding box. 
However, in other cases including the repositioning of the bounding component, the bounding box will not be updated automatically. In such cases, this method can be used to update the bounding box manually.
